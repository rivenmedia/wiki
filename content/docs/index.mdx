# Getting Started

![step-5](/images/onboard/final.png)

<Callout type="warning">
Riven is under active development, we are constantly working on new features and fixing bugs.

You may see different terms used in Discord and other documentation:
    - **Legacy version**: Also referred to as v0, legacy, or old
    - **Beta version**: Also referred to as v1, v1-beta, beta, new, or dev

**This documentation covers the new Beta version.**

If you still need the legacy (v0) documentation, see the [v0.23.6 README](https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven/tree/v0.23.6?tab=readme-ov-file).
</Callout>

Riven streamlines your media consumption experience by:

1. Automatically discovering new content based on your preferences and watchlists.
2. Efficiently searching for and downloading high-quality media files via debrid services.
3. Organizing your media library using RivenVFS, a high-performance virtual filesystem.
4. Streaming content on-demand with intelligent caching and prefetching.
5. Seamlessly integrating with your chosen media server for immediate streaming access.
6. Providing a user-friendly web interface for easy management and configuration.

Whether you're a casual viewer or a media enthusiast, Riven offers a powerful, automated solution to keep your media library up-to-date and easily accessible.

## Prerequisites

### Operating System
Riven only supports Linux-based operating systems. For Windows, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is required.

### Required Software
- **Docker**: Required to run Riven in containers. [Learn more](https://www.docker.com/)

### Supported Services

#### Media Servers
- Plex
- Jellyfin
- Emby

#### Debrid Services
- Real-Debrid
- Torbox
- More debrid services coming soon!

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Directories

Before installing Riven, you must configure your filesystem and mount paths. This includes setting up mount propagation on the host for the VFS to work correctly.

See the [Filesystem (VFS)](docs/services/filesystem) page for detailed instructions on:
- Configuring mount propagation on the host
- Setting up volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`
- Understanding the library path and mount path configuration

### Step 2: Docker Compose Configuration

<Callout type="error" title="Did you set up the VFS mount path?">
    Make sure you've completed the [Setup Directories](#setup-directories) step first! 

    **Mount propagation must be configured on the host before running Docker Compose.**
</Callout>


#### Riven Services 
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to run Riven in a containerized environment. It consists of three services:

1. `riven`: The main application (backend).
2. `riven-frontend`: The web interface (frontend).
3. `riven-db`: The database.

#### Docker Hub Tags

Both `spoked/riven` (backend) and `spoked/riven-frontend` (frontend) repositories use the same tagging conventions:

| Tag | Version | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `latest` | v0 (Legacy) | The legacy version of Riven |
| `dev` | v1 (Beta) | Latest development builds - **recommended for beta users** |
| `main` | v1 (Beta) | Same as `dev` - latest development builds |
| Other tags | Various | Branch names or temporarily assigned tags |

<Callout type="tip" title="Which tag should I use?">
    If you're a new user or want the latest features and bug fixes, use the `:dev` or `:main` tag. The `:latest` tag points to the legacy v0 version.
</Callout>

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
    riven-frontend:
        image: spoked/riven-frontend:dev # See Docker Hub Tags in Installation Guide
        container_name: riven-frontend

        healthcheck:
            test: curl -s http://localhost:8080 >/dev/null || exit 1
            interval: 30s
            timeout: 10s
            retries: 10
        volumes:
            - ./data:/riven/data
            - /path/to/riven/mount:/mount:rshared,z
        depends_on:
            riven-db:
                condition: service_healthy

    riven-db:
        image: postgres:16.3-alpine3.20
        container_name: riven-db
        environment:
            PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
            POSTGRES_USER: postgres
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
            POSTGRES_DB: riven
        volumes:
            - ./riven-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
            interval: 10s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
```

Now this won't work as is, you need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to match your setup.

1. Change `TZ` to your timezone.
2. Change `ORIGIN` to the URL you will be accessing the web interface from. For example, if you are planning to run Riven on `https://riven.example.com`,
   change it to `https://riven.example.com`. This is not required if you are running riven behind a reverse proxy like `nginx`, `caddy`, `cosmos` etc.
3. Change `BACKEND_URL` to the URL where the frontend can access the backend.
4. Change `BACKEND_API_KEY` to the Riven backend API key.
5. Change `RIVEN_DATABASE_HOST` to the URL where the backend can access the database. This is not required here as we are running both backend and database in the same network (stack).
6. Change `DIALECT` and `DATABASE_URL` to use the same database as the backend. This is not required here as we are running both backend and database in the same network (stack).
7. Change the mount volume path `/path/to/riven/mount` to your actual host path. **Important**: Keep the `:rshared,z` flags for proper mount propagation!
8. Set up the host mount path with proper propagation as described in the [Filesystem (VFS)](docs/services/filesystem) documentation.

## Running Riven

Depending on how you installed Riven, execute the following command:

<Tabs items={['Docker', 'Local']}>
<Tab value="Docker">
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Local">
    <Callout type="warning" title="Python Version">
        Riven requires Python 3.11 or higher and `poetry` to be installed.
    </Callout>

    ```bash
    poetry install --without dev
    poetry run python /src/main.py
    ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can access the Riven web interface by navigating to the specified `ORIGIN` URL you entered in the `docker-compose.yml` file or your reverse proxy URL.

- Example: `http://localhost:3000`

--- 

## Configuration

Once Riven is running, you can configure it by accessing the web interface. You will be prompted with onboarding steps to set up your debrid service, media server, content services and scraper services.

There are 4 steps in the onboarding process.

### **Step 1**: General Settings

In this step you configure the downloaders (debrid services), rclone mount path, library path, subtitles, etc. See the image below for an example.

![step-1](/images/onboard/step1.png)

---

### **Step 2**: Media Server

In this step you configure the media server and updater settings. See the image below for an example.

![step-2](/images/onboard/step2.png)

---

### **Step 3**: Content Services

In this step you configure the content services like Trakt, Overseerr, etc. See the image below for an example.

![step-3](/images/onboard/step3.png)

---

### **Step 4**: Scraper Services

In this step you configure the scraper services like Torrentio, Zilean, Prowlarr, Jackett, etc. See the image below for an example.

![step-4](/images/onboard/step4.png)

---

**Done!**

Once you have completed the onboarding process, you will be greeted with a beautiful dashboard where you can manage your media library, request items, settings and many more in the future.

![step-5](/images/onboard/final.png)

At this point you can take a look at the [services](docs/services) page to learn more about the various services and how to configure them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Callout type="warn" title="I am seeing CORS errors in the browser console">
    Make sure that the `ORIGIN` environment variable in the `riven-frontend` service is set to the correct URL you are accessing the web interface from. If you are running Riven behind a reverse proxy, you can remove the `ORIGIN` environment variable from the `riven-frontend` service.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="I am seeing an error when trying to save changes">
    If you are seeing an error when trying to save changes, it is most likely due to incorrect configuration or backend failure. Please check the logs of the Riven service to see the error message. If you are unable to resolve the issue, feel free to ask for help in the Riven Discord server.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="I am stuck in an onboarding loop">
