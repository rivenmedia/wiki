# Getting Started

![Homepage](/images/frontend/homepage.webp)

<Callout type="warning">
Riven is under active development, we are constantly working on new features and fixing bugs.

You may see different terms used in Discord and other documentation:
    - **Legacy version**: Also referred to as v0, legacy, or old
    - **Beta version**: Also referred to as v1, new, or dev
</Callout>

Riven streamlines your media consumption experience by:

1. Automatically discovering new content based on your preferences and watchlists.
2. Efficiently searching for and downloading high-quality media files via debrid services.
3. Organizing your media library using RivenVFS, a high-performance virtual filesystem.
4. Streaming content on-demand with intelligent caching and prefetching.
5. Seamlessly integrating with your chosen media server for immediate streaming access.
6. Providing a user-friendly web interface for easy management and configuration.

Whether you're a casual viewer or a media enthusiast, Riven offers a powerful, automated solution to keep your media library up-to-date and easily accessible.

## Prerequisites

### Operating System
Riven only supports Linux-based operating systems. For Windows, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is required.

<Callout type="warn">
    If you are using WSL, it's recommended to install docker on WSL and not on Windows to avoid issues. 
</Callout>

### Required Software
- **Docker**: Required to run Riven. [Learn more](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation


<Steps>
<Step>

### Step 1: Set Up Directories

Before installing Riven, you must configure your filesystem and mount paths. This includes setting up mount propagation on the host for the VFS to work correctly.

See the [Filesystem (VFS)](docs/services/filesystem) page for detailed instructions on:
- Configuring mount propagation on the host
- Setting up volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`
- Understanding the library path and mount path configuration

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Docker Compose Configuration

<Callout type="error" title="Did you set up the VFS mount path?">
    Make sure you've completed the [Setup Directories](#step-1-set-up-directories) step first! 

    **Mount propagation must be configured on the host before running Docker Compose.**
</Callout>


#### Riven Services 
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to run Riven in a containerized environment. It consists of three services:

1. `riven`: The main application (backend).
2. `riven-frontend`: The web interface (frontend).
3. `riven-db`: The database.

#### Docker Hub Tags

Both `spoked/riven` (backend) and `spoked/riven-frontend` (frontend) repositories use the same tagging conventions:

| Tag | Version | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `latest` | v0 (Legacy) | The legacy version of Riven |
| `dev` | v1 (Beta) | Latest development builds - **recommended for beta users** |
| `main` | v1 (Beta) | Same as `dev` - latest development builds |
| Other tags | Various | Branch names or temporarily assigned tags |

<Callout type="tip" title="Which tag should I use?">
    If you're a new user or want the latest features and bug fixes, use the `:dev` or `:main` tag. The `:latest` tag points to the legacy v0 version.

            retries: 10
        volumes:

    riven-db:
        image: postgres:17-alpine
        container_name: riven-db
        environment:
            PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
            POSTGRES_USER: postgres
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
            POSTGRES_DB: riven
        volumes:
            - riven-pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
            interval: 10s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
```

Now this won't work as is, you need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to match your setup.

1. Change `TZ` to your timezone in both riven & riven-frontend.

2. `riven-frontend` service:
    - Change `ORIGIN` to the URL you will be accessing the web interface from. For example, if you are planning to run Riven on `https://riven.example.com`,
      change it to `https://riven.example.com`.
    - Change `BACKEND_URL` to the URL where the frontend can access the backend.
    - Change `BACKEND_API_KEY` to the Riven backend API key. This can be found in the backend `settings.json` file which is generated on first run,
      or you can set it using `RIVEN_API_KEY` environment variable in `riven` service.
    - Generate a random secret key (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`) and set it to `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable in `riven-frontend` service.

3. `riven` service:
    - Set `PUID` & `PGID` to your user ID & group ID. This is usually 1000 for both, but you can find it using `id -u` & `id -g` commands.
    - `RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_MOUNT_PATH` is the path where the virtual filesystem will be mounted. `RIVEN_UPDATERS_LIBRARY_PATH` is the path where the media servers will
      and see your library. Make sure you have setup the host mount path with proper propagation as described in the [Filesystem (VFS)](docs/services/filesystem) documentation.
      These both environment variables are same path if you are running then locally (not using docker).

</Step>

<Step>

## Running Riven

Depending on how you installed Riven, execute the following command:

<Tabs items={['Docker', 'Local']}>
<Tab value="Docker">
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Local">
    <Callout type="warning" title="Python Version">
        Riven requires Python 3.12 or higher and `uv` to be installed.
    </Callout>

    ```bash
    make install
    make run
    ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can access the Riven web interface by navigating to the specified `ORIGIN` URL you entered in the `docker-compose.yml` file or your reverse proxy URL.

- Example: `http://localhost:3000`

</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Once Riven is running, you can configure it editing the `settings.json` file in the `data` directory attached to the `riven` container or through the web interface.

At this point you can take a look at the [services](docs/services) page to learn more about the various services and how to configure them.
