## **Overseerr**

- **enabled** (boolean): Boolean value to enable or disable the service. Default is true.
    - Example: `true`
- **update_interval** (integer): The interval in seconds at which the service will check for updates. Default is 60 seconds.
    - Example: `60`
- **url** (string): The URL of your Overseerr instance. Default is "http://localhost:5055".
    - Example: `"http://localhost:5055"`

### Setting up Overseerr Webhook

- Go to the settings page on Overseerr
- Click on `Notifications`
- Click on `Webhook` on the end
- Toggle `Enable Agent` so that it's enabled
- For the Webhook URL:
  - Enter the FQDN, IP or `localhost` to your Riven instance, and then be sure to add `/api/v1/webhook/overseerr` at the end of it
- Authorization Header should look like `Berear <YOUR_RIVEN_API_KEY>`
- Leave the rest of the settings default, however you'll want to enable these Notification types:
  - `Request Automatically Approved`
  - `Request Approved`

So that only approved requests will get sent from the webhook from Overseerr. Adjust this based on your needs. Any of the following examples might be correct depending on your setup.

- Example 1: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/webhook/overseerr`
- Example 2: `http://riven:8080/api/v1/webhook/overseerr`

After all that's setup, you should be good to go. If you experience any issues, double check the ip/port you're using to access the backend of Riven is correct. The backend port of Riven is `8080` by default.
