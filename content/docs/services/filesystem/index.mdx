# Filesystem - RivenVFS

Riven uses **RivenVFS** (Riven Virtual File System), a high-performance FUSE-based virtual filesystem designed for streaming media content directly from debrid services like Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, and TorBox.

<Callout type="info">
**What happened to symlinks?**

RivenVFS replaces the old symlink-based system. Instead of creating symlinks to remote files, Riven now mounts a FUSE filesystem that streams content on-demand with intelligent caching and prefetching.
</Callout>

---

## How RivenVFS Works

RivenVFS creates a virtual filesystem that appears as regular files and directories to your media server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby), but actually streams content directly from your debrid service when accessed.

### Key Features

- **HTTP Range Request Support**: Efficient streaming with support for seeking during playback
- **Intelligent Caching**: On-disk cache with configurable size and eviction policies
- **Prefetching**: Automatically fetches ahead to ensure smooth playback
- **Multi-User Fair Scheduling**: Handles multiple concurrent streams efficiently
- **Automatic URL Management**: Handles URL expiration and refresh from debrid providers
- **HTTP/2 Support**: Uses HTTP/2 multiplexing for better performance

### How It Works

1. **Mounting**: Riven mounts a FUSE filesystem at your configured `mount_path` (e.g., `/mount`)
2. **File Registration**: When media is downloaded via your debrid service, RivenVFS registers the file in the virtual filesystem
3. **Directory Structure**: Files are organized in directories like `/mount/movies/`, `/mount/shows/`
4. **Streaming**: When your media server accesses a file, RivenVFS:
   - Checks the cache for requested data
   - Fetches chunks from the debrid service if not cached
   - Prefetches ahead for smooth playback
   - Stores frequently accessed data in cache

## Configuration

### Mount Path Settings

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical: Container vs Host Paths**

The `mount_path` should be set to the **container path** (e.g., `/mount`), not the host path. Both Riven and your media server must use the same container path to access the VFS.
</Callout>

- **mount_path** (Path): The path where RivenVFS mounts the filesystem inside the container
    - Example: `/mount`
    - This is where your media files will appear
    - Your media server should point to subdirectories like `/mount/movies`, `/mount/shows`

- **separate_anime_dirs** (boolean): Create separate top-level directories for anime content
    - Example: `false`
    - When `true`: Creates `/mount/anime_movies` and `/mount/anime_shows`
    - When `false`: Anime is mixed with regular content in `/mount/movies` and `/mount/shows`

<Callout type="warn">
**Set this during initial setup!**

Changing `separate_anime_dirs` after you've already added content may require re-scanning your media libraries.
</Callout>

---

## Cache Configuration

RivenVFS uses an on-disk cache to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage. The cache stores frequently accessed chunks of media files.

### Cache Settings

- **cache_dir** (Path): Directory to store cache files
    - Example: `/dev/shm/riven-cache` (RAM-based tmpfs for best performance)
    - Alternative: `/path/to/disk/cache` (persistent storage)
    - Must be writable by the user running Riven

- **cache_max_size_mb** (integer): Maximum cache size in megabytes
    - Example: `10240` (10 GiB)
    - Default: `10240` MB (10 GiB)
    - Adjust based on available RAM/disk space

- **cache_eviction** (string): Cache eviction policy
    - Options: `"LRU"` or `"TTL"`
    - Default: `"LRU"`
    - **LRU** (Least Recently Used): Removes least recently accessed data when cache is full
    - **TTL** (Time To Live): Removes data older than `cache_ttl_seconds`, then falls back to LRU if needed

- **cache_ttl_seconds** (integer): Time-to-live for cached data when using TTL eviction
    - Example: `7200` (2 hours)
    - Default: `7200` seconds
    - Only used when `cache_eviction = "TTL"`

- **cache_metrics** (boolean): Enable cache performance metrics logging
    - Example: `true`
    - Default: `true`
    - Useful for monitoring cache hit rates and performance

---

## Streaming & Prefetching Settings

These settings control how RivenVFS fetches data from your debrid service.

- **chunk_size_mb** (integer): Size of individual CDN requests in megabytes
    - Example: `8`
    - Default: `8` MB
    - Smaller chunks: More frequent requests, better for seeking
    - Larger chunks: Fewer requests, better for sequential playback
    - Recommended range: 4-32 MB

- **fetch_ahead_chunks** (integer): Number of chunks to prefetch ahead
    - Example: `4`
    - Default: `4` chunks
    - Total prefetch = `chunk_size_mb` × `fetch_ahead_chunks`
    - Example: 8 MB × 4 = 32 MB prefetched
    - Higher values: Smoother playback, more bandwidth usage
    - Lower values: Less bandwidth, possible buffering

<Callout type="info">
**Performance Tuning**

For most users, the defaults work well. Adjust these if you experience:
- **Buffering**: Increase `fetch_ahead_chunks` to 6-8
- **High bandwidth usage**: Decrease `fetch_ahead_chunks` to 2-3
- **Slow seeking**: Decrease `chunk_size_mb` to 4-8 MB
</Callout>

## Mount Setup & Propagation

For VFS to work correctly with Docker, you need to configure mount propagation properly.

### Host Setup (One-time per boot)

```bash
# Create the mount directory
sudo mkdir -p /path/to/riven/mount

# Make it a bind mount
sudo mount --bind /path/to/riven/mount /path/to/riven/mount

# Make it shared (required for propagation to containers)
sudo mount --make-rshared /path/to/riven/mount

# Verify propagation
findmnt -T /path/to/riven/mount -o TARGET,PROPAGATION
# Should show: shared or rshared
```

### Automatic Mount on Boot

**Option A - systemd unit:**

Create `/etc/systemd/system/riven-bind-shared.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Make Riven mount bind shared
After=local-fs.target
Before=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mount --bind /path/to/riven/mount /path/to/riven/mount
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mount --make-rshared /path/to/riven/mount
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable it:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now riven-bind-shared.service
```

**Option B - fstab entry:**

Add to `/etc/fstab`:
```
/path/to/riven/mount  /path/to/riven/mount  none  bind,rshared  0  0
```

---

## Docker Configuration

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  riven:
    image: spoked/riven:latest
    container_name: riven
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_MOUNT_PATH=/mount
      - RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_DIR=/dev/shm/riven-cache
      - RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_MB=10240
    volumes:
      - /path/to/riven/data:/riven/data
      - /path/to/riven/mount:/mount:rshared,z
    depends_on:
      - riven_postgres

  # Your media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby)
  plex:
    image: plexinc/pms-docker
    container_name: plex
    volumes:
      - /path/to/riven/mount:/mount:rslave,z
    # ... other config
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Important Volume Flags**

- **Riven container**: Use `:rshared,z` - Allows Riven to create mounts that propagate to other containers
- **Media server container**: Use `:rslave,z` - Receives mount events from Riven
- **`:z` flag**: Required on SELinux systems (like Fedora, RHEL, CentOS)
</Callout>

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plex/Jellyfin shows empty /mount after Riven restart

This is usually a mount propagation issue.

**1. Verify host path is shared:**
```bash
findmnt -T /path/to/riven/mount -o TARGET,PROPAGATION
# Should show: shared or rshared
```

**2. Verify propagation inside media server container:**
```bash
docker exec -it plex sh -c 'findmnt -T /mount -o TARGET,PROPAGATION,FSTYPE'
# PROPAGATION should be: rslave or rshared
# FSTYPE should show: fuse when VFS is mounted
```

**3. Check Riven logs:**
```bash
docker logs riven | grep -i "vfs\|mount\|fuse"
```

**4. Clear stale FUSE mount (if Riven crashed):**
```bash
sudo fusermount -uz /path/to/riven/mount
# or
sudo umount -l /path/to/riven/mount
# Then restart Riven
```

### Files not appearing in VFS

- Check that items are in "Completed" state in Riven
- Verify the filesystem entry exists in the database
- Check Riven logs for VFS registration errors
- Ensure the debrid service hasn't deleted the files

### Poor streaming performance

- Increase `fetch_ahead_chunks` to 6-8
- Increase `cache_max_size_mb` if you have available RAM/disk
- Use `/dev/shm` for cache (RAM-based) instead of disk
- Check your debrid service's CDN speed
- Verify no bandwidth limits on your network

### Cache filling up too quickly

- Decrease `cache_max_size_mb`
- Switch to `cache_eviction = "TTL"` with shorter `cache_ttl_seconds`
- The cache is meant to fill up - eviction policies handle this automatically

## Environment Variables

You can configure VFS settings via environment variables in your docker-compose.yml:

```bash
# Mount configuration
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_MOUNT_PATH=/mount
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_SEPARATE_ANIME_DIRS=false

# Cache configuration
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_DIR=/dev/shm/riven-cache
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_MB=10240
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=7200
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_EVICTION=LRU
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CACHE_METRICS=true

# Streaming configuration
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=8
RIVEN_FILESYSTEM_FETCH_AHEAD_CHUNKS=4
```

---

## Media Server Configuration

### Plex

Your Plex libraries should point to the VFS mount:

- **Movies Library**: `/mount/movies`
- **Anime Movies Library**: `/mount/anime_movies` (if `separate_anime_dirs = true`)
- **TV Shows Library**: `/mount/shows`
- **Anime Shows Library**: `/mount/anime_shows` (if `separate_anime_dirs = true`)

<Callout type="info">
Enable "Scan my library automatically" in Plex settings to pick up new content as it's added to the VFS.
</Callout>

### Jellyfin / Emby

Same paths as Plex:
- Movies: `/mount/movies`
- Shows: `/mount/shows`
- Anime Movies: `/mount/anime_movies` (if enabled)
- Anime Shows: `/mount/anime_shows` (if enabled)

---

## Performance Tips

1. **Use tmpfs for cache**: Mount `/dev/shm/riven-cache` instead of disk-based cache
2. **Increase cache size**: If you have RAM to spare, increase `cache_max_size_mb`
3. **Prefetch aggressively**: Set `fetch_ahead_chunks` to 6-8 for smoother playback
4. **Monitor metrics**: Enable `cache_metrics = true` to see cache performance in logs
5. **Dedicated network**: If possible, use a fast, dedicated network connection for Riven
6. **HTTP/2 support**: Ensure your debrid service supports HTTP/2 for better multiplexing

---

## Advanced: Multi-User Scenarios

RivenVFS includes fair scheduling for concurrent streams:

- Each file access gets a unique session ID
- Chunks are scheduled with priority (first chunk = highest priority)
- Multiple users share bandwidth fairly using round-robin scheduling
- No single stream can monopolize the prefetch queue

This means multiple users can stream different content simultaneously without one user causing buffering for others.

## Comparison: VFS vs Old Symlink System

| Feature | Old Symlink System | RivenVFS |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Technology** | Symlinks to rclone mount | FUSE virtual filesystem |
| **Dependencies** | Rclone, Zurg (for RD) | None (built-in) |
| **Caching** | Rclone vfs-cache | Native cache with LRU/TTL |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent |
| **Setup Complexity** | High (systemd, rclone config) | Low (built-in) |
| **Prefetching** | Basic | Advanced with fair scheduling |
| **Repair Needed** | Yes (broken symlinks) | No |
| **HTTP/2 Support** | Depends on rclone version | Native support |
