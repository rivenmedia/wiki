# Management Commands

## Resetting the Database

To reset the Postgres database by dropping and recreating the `riven` table, you can use the following commands:

<Callout type="error">
    This will cause **all of the data** in your database to be lost. To include
    metadata, scraped times, and other data that's needed to run Riven.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Docker', 'Env Variable', 'Local']}>
<Tab value="Docker">
Make sure you have the postgres container running, and you should `docker stop riven` before running the following commands.

```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS riven;"
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE riven;"
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="Env Variable">
Set the `HARD_RESET` environment variable to `true` in your `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
HARD_RESET=true
```

Then, restart Riven. Be sure to set `HARD_RESET` back to `false` after the reset is complete.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Local">
Make sure you have the postgres container running, before running the following commands.

```bash
rm -rf data/alembic/
poetry run python src/main.py --hard_reset_db
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After the database is reset, upon restarting Riven, we will load back in the symlinks and re-index your library.

## Resetting the Subtitles Database

To reset the Subtitles database by deleting the `subliminal.dbm*` files, you can use the following command:

```bash
rm -r data/subliminal.dbm*
```

This needs to point to the `data` directory that the `settings.json` file is located in.

<Callout type="warn">
    This will delete all of your Subtitles database files, and you will lose all
    your Subtitles.
</Callout>

<Callout>
    This is not necessary and only needed if you're experiencing issues with the
    Subtitles specifically.
</Callout>

## Trigger Symlink Repair

To trigger a symlink repair, you can use one of the following methods:

<Tabs items={['Local', 'Env Variable']}>
<Tab value="Local">
```bash
poetry run python ./src/main.py --fix_symlinks
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Env Variable">
Set the `FIX_SYMLINKS` environment variable to `true` in your `.env` file.

```yml
FIX_SYMLINKS=true
```

Then, restart Riven. Be sure to set `FIX_SYMLINKS` back to `false` after the repair is complete.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can also set the symlink repair option from the Riven settings, and just lower the interval to 1 hour.
